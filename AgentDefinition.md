1. A DevOps-Style Pipeline for Our AI “Project Maker”

Plan & Prioritize (Sprint Planning)

Agent: PlanningAgent

Prompt: “Given the product backlog, pick the next highest-value slice and decompose into tasks.”

Design & Spec (Lightweight)

Agent: DesignAgent

Prompt: “For this feature, outline the module interfaces, data flows, and any schema or class definitions needed.”

Develop & Code

Agent: CodingAgent

Prompt: “Implement the feature according to the spec. Include docstrings and type hints.”

Automated Testing

Agent: TestAgent

Prompt: “Write unit tests (and property-based tests if applicable) covering edge cases for this feature.”

Build & Integrate

Agent: CICDAgent

Prompt: “Simulate a CI pipeline: install dependencies, run lint, run tests, and report pass/fail.”

Review & Feedback

Agent: ReviewAgent

Prompt: “Analyze code diffs and test results. Flag style issues or potential bugs and suggest improvements.”

Deploy & Release

Agent: DeployAgent

Prompt: “Package the artifact (wheel, Docker image, etc.), version bump according to semver, and push to registry.”

Monitor & Iterate

Agent: MonitorAgent

Prompt: “Collect logs or metrics from the latest release. Identify any errors or performance regressions and open new backlog items.”

3. Communication Flow

PlanningAgent fetches the backlog from a shared store (e.g., a JSON or Git issue tracker).

It hands the chosen task to DesignAgent, which returns a spec JSON.

CodingAgent implements code in a feature branch; on completion, it notifies TestAgent.

TestAgent generates tests and runs them; results go to CICDAgent.

CICDAgent runs lint, tests, packaging scripts—if any step fails, it notifies ReviewAgent to triage.

Once green, DeployAgent publishes and posts deployment status.

MonitorAgent begins watching logs/metrics and loops issues back to PlanningAgent.
